# Linear search
A [linear search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_search) moves sequentially through a list looking for a target value.

## Characteristics
|Time complexity
|-
|Θ(n)

|Space complexity |Notes
|- |-
|Θ(1) |Space taken by linear search is the same for any number of elements of the list

### Optimising
A simple performance optimisation is to locate the values requested more frequently at the start of the list to minimise iterations.
