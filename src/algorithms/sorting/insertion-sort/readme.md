# Insertion sort
An [insertion sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort) is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.

An insertion sort is analogous to sorting a hand of playing cards i.e. take one card and then look at the rest with the intent of building up an ordered hand.
