# Bubble sort
A [bubble sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort) is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through a list to be sorted, comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.

The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, indicating the list is sorted. Sometimes referred to as a sinking sort.
