# Merge sort
An [merge sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort) is a simple sorting algorithm that recursively splits a list into two similarly sized lists (_left_ and _right_), sorts each list, and merges the result.

## Characteristics
|Time complexity
|-
|O(n log n)

|Space complexity |Notes
|- |-
|O(n) |In this implementation two temporary lists are created and merged recursively
