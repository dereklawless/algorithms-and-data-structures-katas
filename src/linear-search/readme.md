# Linear search
A linear search moves sequentially through a collection or data structure looking for a matching value.

### Performance characteristics
#### Time complexity
|Retrieval
|-
|O(n)

#### Optimising
A simple performance optimisation is to keep values requested more frequently at the start of the collection or structure to minimise iterations.
